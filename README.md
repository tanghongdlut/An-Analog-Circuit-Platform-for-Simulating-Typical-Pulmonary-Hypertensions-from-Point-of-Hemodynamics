# An-Analog-Circuit-Platform-for-Simulating-Typical-Pulmonary-Hypertensions-from-Point-of-Hemodynamics
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) behaves unusual hemodynamic states characterized by abnormal high blood pressure in pulmonary artery. This study sets up an analog circuit platform of human circulation system to simulate hemodynamic abnormalities of PH caused by different etiologies and pathogenesis. Four typical causes are considered. They are distal pulmonary artery stenosis (DPAS), left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and mitral stenosis (MS). The authors propose a simulation method and regulation rules for chambers, vessel to adapt the abnormal hemodynamic conditions for each cause. The occurrence and development progress of each PH are simulated over time in the platform. The blood pressure, blood flow, pressure-volume relationship for chambers, vessels are numerically calculated in each PH progress. It is shown that the simulation results for the PHs are close to clinical investigations. The performances prove that the platform is qualified and effective for computer simulation of PHs. It could be a quite powerful tool to understand the hemodynamic mechanism of PH caused by various etiologies and pathogenesis.
